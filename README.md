ABOUT THIS PROJECT
========

A look at achievement gap data (English & Language Arts) using Smarter Balance assessment scores from 2015 in the state of Connecticut. 

All attributes for maps contained within the map HTML files, as well as access to student achievement data, as provided by the CT State Department of Education.

Constructed during fellowship at CT Council for Education Reform.

Minor notes:

Included R-script illustrates how student assessment data was merged with map shapefiles, which were very helpfully publicly provided by University of Connecticut --- attributes are (of course) stamped with each map.

The student assessment data had already been cleaned and compiled prior to the merging.
